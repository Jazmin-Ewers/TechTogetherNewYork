### Inspiration
With the Eviction Moratorium soon coming to an end, this seemed like one of the most pressing issues many citizens of New York will be facing.
We also drew inspiration from one of our team member's experience with an intimidating landlord and information deluge.
We wanted our app to not only provide reliable resources and facts, but also be a safe haven from the scary and confusing world of New York Housing Laws.

### Development
We had several plans of attack, and the most compelling was creating an early Natural Language Processing approach.
To make out program scalable, it would be best to use a Dictionary / HashMap structure.

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
